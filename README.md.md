## About
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for a 5-day course on AI agents. The notebooks appear to be day-wise lessons covering prompts, agent architectures, tools, memory, observability, evaluation, inter-agent communication, and deployment.

## Files in this repository
- `.gitignore` — Typical git ignore file.
- `LICENSE` — BSL-1.0 license file for the repository.
- `README.md` — (This file) A summary of the repository contents.
- `day-1a-from-prompt-to-action.ipynb` — Notebook covering how to turn prompts into agent actions (Day 1, part A).
- `day-1b-agent-architectures.ipynb` — Notebook on different agent architectures (Day 1, part B).
- `day-2a-agent-tools.ipynb` — Notebook introducing agent tools and integrations (Day 2, part A).
- `day-2b-agent-tools-best-practices.ipynb` — Best practices for designing and using agent tools (Day 2, part B).
- `day-3a-agent-sessions.ipynb` — Sessions management and interaction patterns for agents (Day 3, part A).
- `day-3b-agent-memory.ipynb` — Techniques for agent memory and state persistence (Day 3, part B).
- `day-4a-agent-observability.ipynb` — Observability: logging, metrics, and tracing for agents (Day 4, part A).
- `day-4b-agent-evaluation.ipynb` — Evaluation strategies and metrics for agent performance (Day 4, part B).
- `day-5a-agent2agent-communication.ipynb` — Design patterns for communication between agents (Day 5, part A).
- `day-5b-agent-deployment.xpynb` — Deployment strategies for agents (Day 5, part B). Note: filename has a `.xpynb` extension which may be a typo; treat as a Jupyter notebook.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krishnab0841/Google_5_days_AI_agents_course.git
   ```
2. Install Jupyter (if not already):
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebooks:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   then navigate to the repository folder and open the desired `.ipynb` file.

## Notes & Recommendations
- The notebooks appear to be educational materials — expect explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises.
- The `day-5b-agent-deployment.xpynb` filename likely contains a small typo (`.xpynb`); rename to `.ipynb` if needed.
- If you want me to extract summaries or convert these notebooks into scripts, slides, or a single consolidated report, tell me which notebooks you'd like summarized and I will generate them.
