**Platform:** Kaggle  
**Host:** Google

## 🎯 Course Objectives

- Understanding core agent components: Models, Tools, Orchestration, Memory, and Evaluation
- Learning Agent Ops: Reliability, governance, and security
- Building agents with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini
- Implementing interoperability using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Deploying production-ready AI agent systems
